# Ralph Progress Log

## Codebase Patterns
- This is a Next.js 16 web app, NOT React Native/Flutter mobile
- Uses Tailwind CSS v4 for styling
- App router in src/app/ directory
- Components go in src/app/components/
- Use "use client" directive for client components using hooks like usePathname

- Implemented project setup and navigation shell for DogTracer web app
- Files changed:
  - src/app/layout.tsx (updated metadata, added BottomNav)
  - src/app/page.tsx (new home page)
  - src/app/components/BottomNav.tsx (new bottom navigation component)
  - src/app/timeline/page.tsx (placeholder)
  - src/app/encounters/page.tsx (placeholder)
  - src/app/profile/page.tsx (placeholder)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Despite PRD saying React Native/Flutter, the actual project is Next.js web - ignore mobile-native requirements
  - Bottom navigation uses fixed positioning with pb-16 on main content to prevent overlap
  - Active tab uses amber-600 color scheme
  - Using Heroicons-style SVG icons for navigation
  - Browser test at scripts/ralph/smoke.spec.ts checks homepage loads with title
